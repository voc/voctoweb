  %h2 Direct Download

  :markdown
    You can download all files directly from our [CDN](https://cdn.media.ccc.de). The MP4 files might contain multiple audio tracks when we were provided live translations e.g. from [c3lingo](https://c3lingo.org). Some files even contain an additional video track with only the slides. Most desktop video players allow you to choose between them. Please look for the "tracks selection" in your desktop video player e.g. VLC. Subtitles are provided by [c3subtitles](https://c3subtitles.de) and should be automatically found, when you drop them beside the video files.
